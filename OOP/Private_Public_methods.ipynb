A private method in Python is intended to be used only within its own class or object, not from outside the class.\n","\n","### Underscore Notation (`_`):\n","\n","1. **Single Leading Underscore (`_method`)**:\n","   - This is a convention to indicate that a method or attribute is intended for internal use within the class.\n","   - It's a hint to other programmers that this method or attribute is supposed to be \"private\" and not accessed from outside the class.\n","   - However, this is only a convention and is not enforced by Python. The method or attribute can still be accessed normally from outside the class.\n","\n","2. **Double Leading Underscore (`__method`)**:\n","   - When you see a method or attribute with double underscores at the beginning, it triggers name mangling in Python.\n","   - Name mangling is a process where the interpreter changes the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to create subclasses that accidentally override the private methods and attributes of their superclasses.\n","   - For example, a method named `__method` in a class named `MyClass` will be internally changed to `_MyClass__method`.\n","\n","3. **Single Trailing Underscore (`method_`)**:\n","   - This is used to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords. For example, `class_` can be used as a variable name, since `class` is a reserved keyword in Python.\n","\n","### Usage:\n","\n","- The single leading underscore is a strong convention in Python for \"private\" methods, signaling that it's an implementation detail and should not be used externally. However, it's not a hard rule, and Python doesn't enforce access restrictions.\n","- The double underscore for name mangling is useful in specific scenarios, particularly in inheritance and subclassing, where you want to avoid accidental method overriding.\n","\n","\n","\n","In the example above, `_private_method` is intended to be a private method due to the single underscore prefix, but it can still be accessed from outside the class. The use of the underscore is more about conveying intent and following Python conventions than enforcing access control."],"metadata":{"id":"QqjnyvWWgxou"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"hc3Dwv2SgwmF"},"outputs":[],"source":["### Example:\n","\n","\n","class MyClass:\n","    def public_method(self):\n","        return \"This is a public method\"\n","\n","    def _private_method(self):\n","        return \"This is a 'private' method\"\n","\n","# Usage\n","obj = MyClass()\n","print(obj.public_method())  # Accessible\n","print(obj._private_method())  # Still accessible, but not recommended\n"]}]}
